They have a more of a streamlined approach than their competitors because they have seperate kiosks for rice/breads and another for curries etc. This lets them serve a large number of people very quickly. The food was great and the price was a steal. The only negative factor is the lack of seating provided but technically that shouldn't be a factor at all considering its a roadside stall and it adds to the vibe of the place."

A small door to the kitchen and the dining area. We had ediyapam  and chilli  beef  half portion, bread omlet, chicken bread omlet. Chilli beef had good quantity. It had fresh taste and combination with ediyapam was very good. Bread omlet is something is I'm having first time in my life. And I'm not disappointed. Bread was soft. Omlet was perfectly cooked. With tomato sauce it was good."

Some staff are well behaving but cashier uncle is some rude minded he may spoil your all impressions. We can get unlimited rice . Frying remains with chicken fry is really awesome with rice must try it there. There is no specific dine in space we ate in the footpaths ."

They have a more of a streamlined approach than their competitors because they have seperate kiosks for rice/breads and another for curries etc. This lets them serve a large number of people very quickly. The food was great and the price was a steal. The only negative factor is the lack of seating provided but technically that shouldn't be a factor at all considering its a roadside stall and it adds to the vibe of the place."
